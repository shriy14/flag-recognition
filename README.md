Flag Recognition 
=====================================================

An Aplication of Computer Vision and Image Processing
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project utilizes Computer Vision and Image Processing to generate colour masks for the differently coloured portions of a flag, and subsequently identifies the nationality of the user uploaded flag.
The interface is developed using streamlit, whereas the image processing utilizes the cv2 library available in Python.
